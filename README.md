## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

###  Calendar Table using DAX

To enable time-based analysis, a custom **calendar table** was created using the `ADDCOLUMNS` and `CALENDAR` functions in DAX:

```dax
Date_table = 
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR(MIN(Fact_orders[Date]), MAX(Fact_orders[Date])),
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "Month_Name", FORMAT([Date], "MMM"),
    "Month_id", MONTH([Date]),
    "Day of week", FORMAT([Date], "DDDD"),
    "week id", WEEKDAY([Date])
)
