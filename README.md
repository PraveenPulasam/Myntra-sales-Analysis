ðŸ›  Technical Implementation
 Calendar Table using DAX
To enable time-based analysis, a custom calendar table was created using the ADDCOLUMNS and CALENDAR functions in DAX:

Date_table = 
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR(MIN(Fact_orders[Date]), MAX(Fact_orders[Date])),
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "Month_Name", FORMAT([Date], "MMM"),
    "Month_id", MONTH([Date]),
    "Day of week", FORMAT([Date], "DDDD"),
    "week id", WEEKDAY([Date])
)

"Clear All Filters" Bookmark
For improved usability, a "Clear All Filters" button was implemented using Power BI's bookmarking feature. This allows users to instantly reset all applied filters and return to the default view of the dashboard with a single click, which enhances the user experience.

Brand and Product Name Hierarchy
To facilitate a multi-level analysis of product performance, a hierarchy was created for Brand Name and Product Name within a matrix visual. This allows users to drill down from a high-level brand view to see the performance of individual products under that brand, providing deeper insights into the product portfolio.

 Future Enhancements
Predictive Analytics: Incorporate forecasting models to predict future sales trends.

Customer Segmentation: Perform RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers.

Inventory Management: Integrate inventory data to analyze stock levels and prevent stockouts.
