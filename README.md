## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

###  Calendar Table using DAX

To enable time-based analysis, a custom **calendar table** was created using the `ADDCOLUMNS` and `CALENDAR` functions in DAX:

```dax
Date_table = 
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR(MIN(Fact_orders[Date]), MAX(Fact_orders[Date])),
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "Month_Name", FORMAT([Date], "MMM"),
    "Month_id", MONTH([Date]),
    "Day of week", FORMAT([Date], "DDDD"),
    "week id", WEEKDAY([Date])
)
## Clear All Filters Bookmark
To enhance usability, a "Clear All Filters" button was implemented using Power BIâ€™s Bookmark feature. This lets users reset all filters and return to the default dashboard view instantlyâ€”improving navigation and user experience.

## Brand and Product Name Hierarchy
A multi-level hierarchy was created for Brand Name â†’ Product Name within a matrix visual. This allows users to:

Start with a high-level brand view

Drill down to individual product performance

This drill-down capability provides deeper insights into specific product trends under each brand.

##Future Enhancements
### Predictive Analytics
Incorporate Power BIâ€™s forecasting tools or use Python/R integration to predict future sales trends.

### Customer Segmentation
Apply RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to identify and target high-value customer segments.

### Inventory Management Integration
Combine inventory data to:

Analyze stock availability

Prevent stockouts

Optimize procurement and fulfillment
